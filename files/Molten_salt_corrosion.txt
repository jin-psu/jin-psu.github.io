<p style='text-align: justify'> Corrosion of structural materials in the environment of molten salts is a major concern to the long-term reliability of molten salt reactors. The concurrent radiation condition complicates the corrosion process. These harsh environments make it extremely non-trivial to setup experiments. Therefore, a key advancement for corrosion control is to build an effective predictive model to describe long time-scale materials corrosion behavior. The construction of a comprehensive model would need to consider the complex surface and bulk processes. This corrosion model, combining atomistic calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo evolution of the system, is the aim of this project, and it is inevitably across multiple scales and multiple materials species. </p>
