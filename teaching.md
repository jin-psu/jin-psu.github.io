### NucE597-004  Special topics:  Computational nuclear  materials  
 Course Description
The combination of advances in computational methods, high-performance computing, and experimental characterization techniques in materials science has pushed the development of a multiscale modeling paradigm to understand and predict materials behavior. In nuclear applications, high-fidelity materials models have the potential of predicting the evolution and failure of fuels and structural components, and accelerating the design and qualification of new materials under extreme environments. The inherently wide range of time and space in physical phenomena that control the microstructural evolution of materials under irradiation necessitates a proper description over multiple temporal and spatial scales. In this course, a hierarchy of computational methods pertinent to nuclear materials is introduced in a bottom-up fashion, including,  
- Collision theory  
- Molecular-scale thermodynamic and kinetic processes  
- Meso-scale microstructural evolution  
- Macro-scale fuel performance models  

The theoretical background, limitations, applications of each computational technique, and hands-on practice will be included in this course. Students will complete a term project of their own interest.
